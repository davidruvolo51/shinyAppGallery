# Shiny Gallery

This repo has a collection of shiny applications that demonstrate the methods discussed in the [shiny tutorials](https://davidruvolo51.github.io/shinytutorials/) project and other approaches for building shiny apps. All applications are built using the [Golem Framework for Shiny applications](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem).

There are a handful of applications available and more on the way. The following lists the apps and the current status.
